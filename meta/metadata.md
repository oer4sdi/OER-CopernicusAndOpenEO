## Abstract

In this technical tutorial on the Copernicus data infrastructure, you will learn about the Copernicus Earth Observation Infrastructure, the **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem** and **OpenEO**. 

### Content:
* Chapter 1: Overview
* Chapter 2: Background on the Copernicus Program, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and processing of EO-Data
* Chapter 3: Practical exercise on how to use the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and OpenEO
* Chapter 4: Summary

This tutorial is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of Spatial Information Infrastructures. We assume that you have some basic knowledge about remote sensing, Python and web technologies. However, even without this prior knowledge you will be able to follow and to achieve the main learning objectives. Your computer should have 8 GB of usable RAM and 2 GB of usable hard disk space to download and use the software for this tutorial.
