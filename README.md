# OER_CopernicusAndOpenEO
Introduction to working with Copernicus data and openEO         

This repository contains all the materials used to create and publish an Open Educational Resource (OER) on working with Copernicus data and openEO. The OER module provides a) some background information on the Copernicus Program, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and processing of earth observation (EO)-Data and b) a practical exercise on how to use the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and OpenEO through a Python Notebook. 

### Content:
* Chapter 1: Overview
* Chapter 2: Background on the Copernicus Program, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and processing of EO-Data
* Chapter 3: Practical exercise on how to use the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and OpenEO
* Chapter 4: Wrap up and summary

The OER is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their skills in working with EO-Data. Users should have some basic knowledge of Python and it would not be bad to have some experience with Docker and Jupyter notebooks as well. However, the OER guides you through all these technologies and can also be used to gain some initial practical experience with them. 

### How to use the OER Module

Simply download the [PDF file](\docs\OER-CopernicusAndOpenEO.pdf), read and follow the tutorial..
