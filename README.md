# OER_CopernicusAndOpenEO
Introduction to Working with Copernicus Data and OpenEO

This repository contains all the materials used to create and publish an Open Educational Resource (OER) on working with Copernicus data and OpenEO. The OER module provides:

- Background information on the Copernicus Program, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, and processing of Earth Observation (EO) data.
- A practical exercise on how to use the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and OpenEO through a Python Notebook.

### Content:
* Chapter 1: Overview
* Chapter 2: Background on the Copernicus Program, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, and processing of EO data
* Chapter 3: Practical exercise on how to use the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and OpenEO
* Chapter 4: Wrap-up and summary

The OER is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their skills in working with EO data. Users should have some basic knowledge of Python, and prior experience with Docker and Jupyter Notebooks is beneficial but not required. The OER guides you through these technologies, making it suitable for gaining practical experience.

### How to use the OER Module
