# OER_CopernicusAndOpenEO
In this technical tutorial on the Copernicus data infrastructure, you will learn about the **Copernicus Earth Observation Infrastructure**, the **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem** and **OpenEO**. After working through the tutorial, you will be able to

- understand the purpose and scope of the Copernicus EO infrastructure
- understand the role of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and OpenEO for accessing and processing Copernicus data
- use Python to create information products from Earth observation data using the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem and OpenEO.

### Content:
* Chapter 1: Overview
* Chapter 2: Background on the Copernicus Program, Sentinel-2 data, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, and the openEO API
* Chapter 3: Practical exercise on how to use the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem with Pythin and OpenEO
* Chapter 4: Summary

It takes about 60 minutes to work through this tutorial.

The tutorial is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of Spatial Information Infrastructures. We assume that you have some basic knowledge about remote sensing, Python and web technologies. However, even without this prior knowledge you will be able to follow and to achieve the main learning objectives. Your computer should have 8 GB of usable RAM and 2 GB of usable hard disk space to download and use the software for this tutorial.
